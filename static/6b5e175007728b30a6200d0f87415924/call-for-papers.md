## Scope and Topics

The International Conference on Performance Engineering (ICPE) is the leading international forum for presenting and discussing novel ideas, innovations, trends and experiences in the field of performance engineering. Modern systems, such as big data and machine learning environments, data centers and cloud infrastructures, social networks, peer-to-peer, mobile and wireless systems, cyber-physical systems, the Internet of Things or more traditional ones such as web-based or real-time systems, rely increasingly on distributed and dynamic architectures and pose a challenge to their end-to-end performance management.

ICPE brings together researchers and practitioners to report state-of-the-art and in-progress research on performance engineering of software and systems, including performance measurement, modeling, benchmark design, and run-time performance management. The focus is both on classical metrics such as response time, throughput, resource utilization, and (energy) efficiency, as well as on the relationship of such metrics to other system properties including but not limited to scalability, elasticity, availability, reliability, cost, sustainability, security and privacy. The systems of interest include any type of computing or software system, such as (but not limited to) desktop systems, cloud systems, web-based systems, embedded systems, distributed systems and cyber-physical systems. The handling of performance issues at all stages of software and system life cycles is also of interest.

This year, we particularly encourage researchers to submit their work on the performance engineering of ‘modern’ application domains as well, such as deep learning, blockchain, microservices, Big Data, DevOps and/or Autonomous Systems.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

### Performance modeling of software

- Languages and ontologies
- Methods and tools
- Relationship/integration/tradeoffs with other QoS attributes
- Analytical, simulation and statistical modeling methodologies
- Machine learning and neural networks
- Model validation and calibration techniques
- Automatic model extraction
- Performance modeling and analysis tools

### Performance and software development processes/paradigms

- Software performance testing
- Software performance (anti-)patterns
- Software/performance tool interoperability (models and data interchange formats)
- Performance-oriented design, implementation and configuration management
- Software Performance Engineering and Model-Driven Development
- Gathering, interpreting and exploiting software performance annotations and data
- System sizing and capacity planning techniques
- (Model-driven) Performance requirements engineering
- Relationship between performance and architecture
- Performance and agile methods
- Performance in Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA)
- Software and system scalability and its impact on performance

### Performance measurement, monitoring and analysis

- Application tracing and profiling
- Workload characterization techniques
- Experimental design
- Tools and techniques for performance testing, measurement, profiling and tuning, and analysis of the resulting data

### Benchmarking

- Performance metrics and benchmark suites
- Benchmarking methodologies
- Development of parameterizable, flexible benchmarks
- Benchmark workloads and scenarios
- Use of benchmarks in industry and academia

### Run-time performance management and adaptation

- Machine learning and runtime performance decisions
- Context modeling and analysis
- Runtime model estimation
- Use of models at run-time
- Online performance prediction
- Autonomic resource management
- Utility-based optimization
- Capacity management

### Power and performance, energy efficiency

- Power consumption models and management techniques
- Tradeoffs between performance and energy efficiency
- Performance-driven resource and power management

All other topics related to performance of software and systems.
