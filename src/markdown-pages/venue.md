Rennes is the 2nd-largest digital hub in France (after Paris), and the largest education and research
center in the West of France. With over 60,000 students on a population of 250,000, Rennes is a
peaceful yet vibrant city. It is also an internationally-recognized high-tech R&D center in cloud

Rennes is the home of [IRISA](https://www.irisa.fr/en), which is the largest public research center for Informatics in France (750+
employees including full-time researchers, professors, postdocs, engineers, PhD students, and support
staff).

Rennes is also a major center for industrial R&D with several major companies having a signicant

Hundreds of high-tech SMEs, start-up incubators, etc, complement this ecosystem.

## INRIA Conference center

### Location :

The Beaulieu university campus. This is the main scientific campus in Rennes, which
is located just outside of the city center. It is very easily reachable by bus (10-15 minutes ride from the
city center), and it provides excellent infrastructure for both the workshops and the main conference
at only symbolic cost (or even possibly entirely free).

The conference will be organized at INRIA's conference center. The center
frequently hosts international conferences (among many others: TTL 2015, OPODIS 2015, DASIP 2016,
ICFCA 2017, etc.). The facilities include an auditorium (capacity: 240 seats) with state-of-the-art audio-visual equipment: projector, sound system, possibilities for videoconferences and/or for filming the
presentations, etc. The conference center also includes a reception space suitable for coffee breaks as
well as three smaller rooms (capacity: 50 persons each) which may be used separately or joined
together for lunches, poster sessions, etc. A high-quality Wi-Fi network covers the full center: European
academics will have access to their familiar eduroam network, and individual credentials will be given
to other attendees.
